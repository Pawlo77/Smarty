# Smarty Project
Original plan and project's description goes as follows:

<blockquote>
Smarty is an open source end-to-end maschine learning python library. Providing both high-level and low-level api, it allows easy development of basic models as well as preprocessing and visualizing the data. Based on numpy, it does not support gpu operations, however remains well-scalable, with full control over dtypes and their structure.
</blockquote>

Smarty is an <b>one-person</b> project meant to help me <b>understand the maschine learning algorithms</b> better by implementing most basic pandas and sklearn / tensorflow functions and interface from scratch <i>(only numpy's arrays allowed)</i>
<hr>
For brief description:
<ul>
  <li>Project has <b>full documentation</b> generated by Sphinx based on comments etc from source python files. In order to understand what Smarty is without getting into code, just launch it - clone the repo and open
    <blockquote>./docs/build/html/index.html</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Datasets package - <i>implements basic Pandas DataFrames options as well as Tensorflow DataSets one including</i>
    <ol>
      <li>Getting statistical info</li>
      <li>Rearranging the DataSet by adding columns, rows, ranaming them etc (indexing by column's names allowed)</li>
      <li>Training prosperties like batching the data (with/without reminder), setting target class, reapeating the data for several times, shuffling entries etc</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Models package - <i>implements the accual models, usually for both continous and categorical output</i>
     <ol>
       <li>Dumb models</li>
       <li>Linear models</li>
       <li>Tree models</li>
       <li>Naive Bayes models</li>
       <li>K Nearest Neighbors </li>
       <li>Learning Vector Quantization</li>
       <li>All models inherits from smarty.models.base.BaseModel, which allows to build custom predictors easily.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Metrics module - <i>holds all possible metrics that can be used to evaluate model's performance</i></li>
  <li>Callbacks package -<i> holds callbacks that can be feed to models using batch learning</i>
     <ol>
       <li>Early Stopping</li>
       <li>Learing Rate Sheduler</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Preprocessing package - <i>allows for easy data preprocessing z uzyciem podstawowych funkcji</i>
    <ol>
       <li>One Hot Encoder</li>
       <li>Simple Encoder</li>
       <li>Simple Encoder</li>
       <li>Standard Scaler</li>
       <li>Standard Scaler</li>
    </ol>

  <li>Config module</li>
</ul>
